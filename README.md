# Detect Faces

A Swift command-line tool that uses the Vision and Core Image frameworks to detect faces in an image and draw red rectangles around them.

This tool reads an input image, performs face detection using the Vision framework, and then draws red rectangles around the detected faces using Core Image. The output image is saved as a JPEG file. The input and output image paths can be specified as command-line arguments.

The tool is a great example of how to use the Vision and Core Image frameworks to build a simple but powerful image processing tool. It can be used as a starting point for more complex projects, or as a reference for how to perform face detection and image manipulation in Swift.
